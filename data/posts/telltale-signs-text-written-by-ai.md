A lot of AI generated text still sounds like AI. anyone familiar with these tools can tell. using raw output without edits is a rookie mistake that makes your work feel lazy or off.

If you’re writing with AI and you want it to sound natural, look for these dead giveaways:

### 1. common AI words + phrases

There’s a list of words and phrases that AI uses more frequently than humans. usage of words like “delve” and ”tapestry” have exploded since ChatGPT launched. keeping these in your writing is an obvious sign.

**→ fix**: Check the output against these lists of overused words and phrases:

### 2. excessive hyphenation

AI follows exact spelling and that means it hyphenates compound words: “high-traffic”, “fast-paced”, “short-form”. it might be technically correct but people usually don’t hyphenate these. it also likes to break sentences with dashes - even when it doesn't seem necessary.

**→ fix**: replace dashes with spaces and split into shorter sentences. a good rule of thumb: would you hyphenate it?

### 3. lists of three everywhere

AI loves to use list of three: “readers, clients, or friends” or “lazy, sloppy, and cheap”. nothing wrong with it inherently, but once you notice the frequency it looks unnatural.

**→ fix**: keep the strongest example. ditch the others. change up the number of examples.

### 4. wordy

AI rambles. by default it says in 20 words what could’ve taken 7. this is especially noticeable in tweets, emails, or anything short form.

**→ fix**: You can instruct it be more direct. ask for punchy. or just delete the fluff.
**pro tip**: Add examples of the writing you're targeting to match the wording and length.

### 5. cheesy phrasing

You’ll see stuff like “unlock your full potential” or “navigate the landscape.” they’re cliched and make your text sound like a linkedin post.

**→ fix**: Scan for generic phrasing you wouldn't use and remove or ask AI to replace.

### takeaway

This type of list will continue to change as AI evolves. the more you use AI, the more you'll notice these patterns intuitively. keep this list in mind to draft rapidly while still producing work that feels authentic to you.

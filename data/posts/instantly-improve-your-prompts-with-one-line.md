The single greatest tip to improve your AI prompting is: add **"Ask me clarifying questions."**

You’ll get 10x better results that are much closer to what you really want.

It works because it instructs AI to ask questions and solidify its understanding of what you’re asking for before it does the work.

It’ll check assumptions. It’ll clarify anything ambiguous. It’ll even bring up relevant considerations that you didn’t mention but might impact the output.

Without this line, AI will usually just output its best effort with its initial understanding. If your request was simple that’s probably fine, but if it’s a larger task like writing a product spec, planning a marketing strategy or writing a blog outline, you’ll get a much more relevant result this way.

I love this one because it reduces the need to write a perfect prompt that includes all the required context and makes everything perfectly clear. We’re human, sometimes we overestimate how clear our communication is. This turns it into an interactive dialogue that feels like you’re working with a partner.

**Takeaway**: Add "Ask Me Clarifying Questions" to your prompts to 10x the quality of outputs. Just add it to the end of your prompt.

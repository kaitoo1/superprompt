    "content": "A lot of AI text still sounds like AI to anyone paying attention. Using 100% of AI output directly in your work is a rookie mistake.\n\nIf you’re writing with AI and you want it to sound natural, look for these dead giveaways:\n\n### Sign #1: AI words + phrases\nThere’s a list of words and phrases that AI uses more frequently than humans. Usage of words like “delve” and ”tapestry” have exploded since ChatGPT launched.\n\n**→ The fix**: Check the output against these lists of overused words and phrases:\n\n[10 Phrases Most Overused by AI](https://gptzero.me/news/most-common-ai-vocabulary/)\n\n[The most overused ChatGPT words](https://plusai.com/blog/the-most-overused-chatgpt-words)\n\n### Sign #2: Excessive Hyphenation\nAI follows exact spelling and that means it hyphenates compound words. Ie “high-traffic”, “fast-paced”, “short-form”. It might be technically correct but people usually don’t hyphenate these. It also likes to break sentences with dashes - even when it doesn't seem necessary.\n\n**→ The fix**: replace dashes with spaces and split into shorter sentences.\n\n### Sign #3: Lists of three everywhere\nAI loves to use list of three: “readers, clients, or friends” or “lazy, sloppy, and cheap”. Nothing wrong with it inherently, but once you notice the frequency it looks unnatural.\n\n**→ The fix**: keep the strongest example. ditch the others. Change up the number of examples.\n\n### Sign #4: Wordy\nAI rambles. By default it says in 20 words what could’ve taken 7. This is especially noticeable in tweets, emails, or anything short form. \n\n**→ The fix**: You can instruct it be more direct. ask for punchy. or just delete the fluff.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Add examples of the writing you're targeting to match the wording and length.\n\n### Sign #5: Cheesy Phrasing\nYou’ll see stuff like “unlock your full potential” or “navigate the landscape.” They’re cliched and make your text sound like a linkedin post. \n\n**→ The fix**: Scan for generic phrasing you wouldn't use and remove or ask AI to replace.\n\n### Takeaway\nThis type of list will continue to change as AI evolves. It's good practice to stay in tune with the quirks of these models so that you can identify these signs in anything you publish. The more you use AI, the more you'll notice these patterns intuitively. Then you'll be more adept at using AI to draft rapidly, while still producing work that feels authentic to you.\n\n",

    "content": "ChatGPT can be a superpower but only if you know how to use it. Most beginners give up when they don’t get the perfect response immediately and write AI off as hype.\n\nHere are the most common mistakes people make. Fixing these will immediately improve your prompts and output quality.\n\n### 1. vague prompts = vague results\nasking “write me something good” is like saying “make food.” ok… what kind? for who? when? how much?\n\n→ **fix**: give it direction. tell it what you want, who it’s for, what tone to use, and what not to do. be specific. ask for bullet points, a casual tone, or a 2-line tweet.\n\n### 2. not adding enough context\nchatgpt isn’t a mind reader. if you say “fix my resume” and don’t give it your job history or what role you’re aiming for, you’re wasting your time.\n\n→ **fix**: give it the full picture. tell it your level, your goals, what industry you’re targeting—anything that would help a human help you.\n\n### 3. asking for too much at once\nasking for 10 things at once is a guaranteed mess. you’ll get a long generic answer that doesn’t deliver what you wanted.\n\n→ **fix**: split it up. ask one thing at a time. “give me 5 blog titles.” then “write an outline for #2.” small, clear asks = better answers.\n\n**pro tip**: if you're not sure how to split up the work, you can ask chatgpt to make separate tasks.\n\n### 4. not specifying a tone or style\nwanted to write a social media post but it sounds too serious? you didn’t set the tone. ai defaults to neutral unless you tell it otherwise.\n\n→ **fix**: tell it how to sound. “make it funny,” “keep it casual,” “write like a gen z creator,” whatever fits. don’t know the tone? give an example of what you do like.\n\n### 5. not checking the output\nnever hit publish without checking. sometimes the info is wrong or doesn’t deliver what you asked for. some of it can sound obviously ai.\n\n→ **fix**: read it. tweak the wording. fact check. use ai to get 80% there, then finish it yourself. own the final result.\n\n\n### takeaway\nmost people use ai like a vending machine. press button, get snack. it doesn’t work this way. the more specific you are, the better the output. it’s a lot like working with a human. help it help you.\n\ni see beginners run into these same issues constantly. but the second they learn how to prompt better, their results level up fast. even after using chatgpt for years, anytime i'm getting bad output, it’s because i skipped one of these basics.\n\n\n\n### ps: want better results instantly?\n\nGrab our free library of 50+ high-performing prompts. Real use cases with specific wording + context. Just copy, paste, and go.",

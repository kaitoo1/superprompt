    "content": "AI can churn out text fast but it’s not flawless. Despite their advancement in natural language processing, models like ChatGPT still have quirks and tendencies that come across as “written by AI“ to anyone paying attention. \n\nIf you use these outputs directly for something you'll publish or send to other people, you risk coming off as lazy or cheapening your message. No one wants to spend time reading something that's obviously AI and the author didn't bother checking. Check your outputs against this list to ensure your text sounds more natural.\n\n### Sign #1: Overusing certain words and phrases\nYou might have heard that usage of the word “delve” is skyrocketing because of AI. And when's the last time you actually heard someone say it? Others like “intricate,” “nuanced,” or “tapestry” pop up too. \n\n**The Fix**: Check the output against these lists of overused words and phrases:\n\n[10 Phrases Most Overused by AI](https://gptzero.me/news/most-common-ai-vocabulary/)\n\n[The most overused ChatGPT words](https://plusai.com/blog/the-most-overused-chatgpt-words)\n\n### Sign #2: Excessive Hyphenation\nAI follows exact spelling and that means it hyphenates most compound words. “High traffic” becomes “high-traffic,” “fast paced” turns “fast-paced.” These might be technically correct but most people don't bother hyphenating them in real writing. The frequency of these makes the writing feel unnatural. It also likes to break sentences with dashes - even when it doesn't seem necessary.\n\n**The Fix**: Skim through the output for dashes. Just replace the dash with a space for compound words you wouldn't personally hyphenate, and most hyphenated sentences can be split into two with a period.\n\n### Sign #3: Obsessing Over Lists of Three\nAI loves lists of three to prove a point. Check your AI text and you're bound to see a few lists like “readers, clients, or friends” or “lazy, sloppy, and cheap”. It sounds like someone following a ”How to write an essay rubric.” People don’t always group ideas in neat threes. It's such a noticeable pattern in AI that it feels forced and meaningless.\n\n**The Fix**: Break the pattern. Look for lists of three and only keep the best examples. Don't be afraid to cut to two, or just one.\n\n### Sign #4: Wordy\nThe models are getting better here but by default they still tend to be wordy. Sentences are longer than needed, and you'll see filler words that don't add more meaning to the text.See #3 above.\n\n**The Fix**: Depending on your use case, you can instruct it to be direct or to the point. This makes a big difference for text that usually is on the shorter side like emails and social media posts.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Add examples of the writing you're targeting to match the wording and length.\n\n### Sign #5: Cheesy Phrasing\nThis one's similar to 1. Unless specified otherwise, AI models often use awkward and cheesy phrasing where you might prefer something more direct. This is subjective of course but if you don't want to sound like an educational program for kids you should look out for it. \n\n**The Fix**: If you notice these things, you can just re-prompt and specify things to rephrase. Or you can provide examples of the tone you want to achieve upfront.\n\n### Takeaway\nThis type of list will continue to change as AI evolves. It's good practice to stay in tune with the quirks of these models so that you can identify these signs in anything you publish. The more you use these tools, the more you'll notice these patterns intuitively. Then you'll be more adept at using AI to draft rapidly, while still producing work that feels authentic to you.\n\n",

    "title": "AI for Beginners: 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Using ChatGPT in 2025",
    "date": "2025-04-06",
    "content": "ChatGPT can transform how you work—if you know how to use it. Most beginners, though, get stuck with bland, generic outputs that don’t live up to the AI hype. Here are the _5 biggest mistakes_ new users make and how to fix them.\n\n\n### Mistake #1: Writing Vague Prompts\nAsking \"Write me something good\" is like telling a chef \"Cook me food.\" ChatGPT needs direction, or you’ll get generic, useless output.  \n\n**The Fix**: Be specific. Tell it _what_ you want, _how_ it should sound, and _who_ it’s for. Mention what not to do if you want to narrow down its behavior. Be specific about how you want it to respond. Do you want full sentences or bullet points? A single response or a conversation? \n\n**Pro Tip**: See our [free prompt library](/) for examples of prompts that provide precise instructions to the AI for a variety of tasks.\n\n\n### Mistake #2: Not Providing Enough Context\nChatGPT isn’t a mind reader. If you ask “Improve my resume” without sharing your detailed work experience and the types of jobs you're applying for, it can't give you any useful suggestions. \n\n**The Fix**: Give it the full picture. If you want it to help you learn French, tell it your current level, what specific things you want to improve, how much time you want to spend, etc. You can include these directly in the prompt and AI will use the information to personalize its output. \n\n\n\n### Mistake #3: Asking for Too Much at Once\nThrowing a 10 part question at ChatGPT overwhelms it, because it'll try to do everything at once. You’ll get a jumbled mess instead of clear answers. You also don't get a chance to course correct before it tries to complete all 10 parts.\n\n**The Fix**: Break it down. Ask one thing at a time: “List 5 blog ideas,” then “Write an outline for #1.” Breaking down tasks makes it easier for you to be specific about the desired output as well, which leads to better results. \n\n**Pro Tip**: If you're not sure how to split up the work, you can ask ChatGPT to break it down into separate tasks.\n\n\n\n### Mistake #4: Not specifying a tone or style\n Wanted to write a social media post but it sounds too serious? You didn’t set the tone. ChatGPT defaults to neutral unless you tell it otherwise. You can change how it sounds to fit your needs.\n\n**The Fix**: Add a style cue: “Explain quantum physics in a funny, beginner-friendly way” or “Draft an apology email that acknowledges our mistake and end with a warm sign off.” You can be as specific as you want here, or if you don't have a clear idea, just try something. You can always provide feedback and try another variation. \n\n**Pro Tip**: Add examples of the tone that you want it to use. For example if you're asking it to write an email in your voice, paste in a few emails you've written before.\n\n\n### Mistake #5: Not Double Checking the Output\nChatGPT isn’t perfect. Sometimes it makes stuff up or misunderstands your request. Some of its output can contain phrases that clearly sound like AI. Blindly trusting it is for fools. \n\n**The Fix**: Skim the response. Check stats and ask for sources. If it's off topic refine your prompt. Adjust the wording. Instead of relying on it as a way to get something done in one attempt, use it as a shortcut to get to your destination faster. Use it as an enhancement, not a replacement.  \n\n\n### Takeaway\nAvoiding these five mistakes will cut down on wasted time and frustration with ChatGPT. I see beginners struggling with these all the time, but they see big improvements immediately once they realize how to prompt better. Even as a long time user of ChatGPT, I've noticed that whenever I'm not getting the responses I want, it's because I skipped one of these points. \n\nAnother way to summarize these improvements is to view ChatGPT like hiring a contractor for a task. For best results, you want to be specific, provide sufficient context, and check the outcome. \n\n\n### Start Using ChatGPT Like a Pro Today\nWant to skip the trial and error? We have a [free library of 50+ prompts](/) to help you accomplish specific tasks like improving resumes, writing emails, or learning a language. Each prompt has been worded to precisely instruct the AI for exact results, and it highlights the additional context that you should include. Just copy and paste into ChatGPT.",
